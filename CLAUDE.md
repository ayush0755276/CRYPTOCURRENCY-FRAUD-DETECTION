## Collaborative Multi-Agent & Multi-User Operating Protocol

> **CRITICAL RULE FOR ALL AI AGENTS (GEMINI, CLAUDE, ANTIGRAVITY, ETC.):**
> `GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENT.md` **MUST ALWAYS BE KEPT 100% IDENTICAL AND SYNCHRONIZED**.
> Whenever you make any update to tasks, architecture, or rules in one file, you **MUST immediately replicate the exact changes to all three files**.

### 1. Project Overview & Mission

This repository contains the codebase and research for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** problem statement defined in [PS.txt](file:///a:/SIH/PS.txt):

> **Problem Statement:** "Real-Time Identification of Fraud-Linked Cryptocurrency Exchanges from Victim-Reported Suspect Wallet Addresses through Automated Blockchain Analytics"

#### Core Objective:
Build an automated, real-time crypto-forensics and intelligence platform for Indian Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), integrating with platforms like **NCRP** (National Cybercrime Reporting Portal) and **SAHYOG**. 
The system ingests victim-reported suspect wallet addresses, automatically traces multi-hop fund flows across chains and intermediary/burner wallets, pierces laundering mechanisms (mixers, peeling chains, bridges), attributes the receiving **Exchange / VASP** (Virtual Asset Service Provider), and generates court-admissible forensic dossiers (compliant with Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act / BSA) to facilitate prompt asset freezing.

```

#### Active User Identification Protocol (`.active_user` in `.gitignore`):
* **Local Identity File**: Each developer's machine stores their personal username in a local `.active_user` file at the repository root (`a:/SIH/.active_user`).
* **Gitignored by Design**: `.active_user` is listed in `.gitignore` so one teammate's local identity is **never** committed or pushed to remote.
* **Initial Setup Prompt**: Whenever an AI starts a session and `.active_user` is missing or empty, **the AI MUST halt and ask the user initially**:
  > *"Welcome! Which team member are you? (e.g., HAFIZ, MEMBER_2, etc.)"*
  Once the user answers, the AI creates `.active_user` with that name.
* **AI Routing & Boundaries**:
  1. The AI treats `<ACTIVE_USER>/` as the sole personal folder with full read/write permissions.
  2. The AI maps all milestone tracking to that member's section on the Team Task Board in Section 6.
  3. Folders belonging to other teammates remain strictly **READ-ONLY** by default.

#### Workspace Access Protocol for AI Agents:
1. **Active User's Folder (`<ACTIVE_USER>/`)**:
   * The AI has full read and write access.
   * Prototypes, experiments, scratch scripts, and exploratory code should be authored here first.
2. **Other Users' Folders (`<OTHER_USERS>/`)**:
   * **READ-ONLY by default**. The AI may inspect other members' folders to understand progress, reuse utility functions, or integrate components.
   * **DO NOT** modify, overwrite, or delete code in another member's folder unless explicitly directed by the user.
3. **Shared Stage Folders (`DB/`, `ENGINE/`, `API/`, `FRONTEND/`, etc.)**:
   * Open for collaborative implementation as features graduate from personal drafts to the core pipeline.
   * Ensure modularity, clean documentation, and non-breaking changes.

### 4. Automated Git Synchronization & Zero Data Loss Protocol

> **MANDATORY AUTOMATED GIT BEHAVIOR & SAFETY GATES FOR ALL AGENTS:**
>
> 1. **Live Remote Check — `git fetch origin` then `git status`:**
>    * Plain `git status` is strictly local and does not contact GitHub. Therefore, at the start of every session or before making sync decisions, the AI **MUST run `git fetch origin` first, followed by `git status`**.
>    * This reveals the true live remote state (e.g., whether local is behind, diverged, or up-to-date with teammates on GitHub) without touching working files.
>    * If uncommitted or unstaged changes exist locally, the AI **MUST NOT pull blindly** (which risks overwriting work). Instead, commit the local changes first (`git add .`, `git commit -m "wip: save local progress before sync"`) or ask the user for guidance.
> 2. **Pull at the Start of Every Session:**
>    * Once local state is cleanly committed, run `git pull` (or `git pull --rebase`) to ingest fresh commits from teammates.
> 3. **Push Automatically on Milestone Completion:**
>    * Whenever a unit of work is completed, task trackers are updated, or a milestone is reached, the AI **MUST automatically stage changes, commit with a descriptive message, and run `git push origin main`** so teammates stay in sync.
> 4. **STRICT BAN ON DANGEROUS GIT COMMANDS (ZERO TOLERANCE):**
>    * 🚫 **NEVER RUN `git reset --hard`** (permanently wipes uncommitted work).
>    * 🚫 **NEVER RUN `git push --force` or `-f`** (erases remote history and teammates' commits).
>    * 🚫 **NEVER RUN `git clean -fd`** (deletes untracked drafts and files).
>    * 🚫 **NEVER RUN `git checkout -- .` or `git restore .`** (discards local changes).
>    * 🚫 **NEVER RUN `git stash drop`** without explicit user instruction.
> 5. **User Escalation on Ambiguity & Merge Conflicts:**
>    * If a merge conflict occurs, or if Git reports ambiguous state (untracked overlaps, divergent branches), the AI **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT**.
>    * Display the exact conflicting files, state, and diff to the user.
>    * Ask the user explicitly how they wish to resolve it before executing any resolution commands.

---

### 5. Autonomous Task Tracking Protocol

> **MANDATORY AI BEHAVIOR:**
> Whenever the AI achieves a small milestone, starts a new task, or completes an assigned task, **the AI must directly update the Task Tracker below in ALL THREE FILES (`GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT.md`)**.
> Keep the status updated automatically without waiting for explicit prompt instructions.

### 7. Golden Guidelines for Any AI Agent Working Here
1. **Sync All Three Instruction Files**: Every modification to `GEMINI.md` must be identically copied to `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENT.md`.
2. **Active User Identity**: Check `.active_user` on startup. If missing, ask the user their member name and save it to `.active_user` (which is gitignored).
3. **Automated Git Sync with Safety Gate**: Always run `git fetch origin` then `git status` first to inspect true remote state, commit WIP before pulling, pull at session start, and push on milestone completion.
4. **Strict Ban on Dangerous Commands**: Absolutely no `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `git clean -fd`, or `git restore .`.
5. **Escalate Conflicts & Ambiguity**: If any merge conflict or ambiguous branch state arises, immediately stop and ask the user.
6. **Consult Research First**: Always ground your logic on the 10 Technical Blueprint sets in `RESEARCH/`.
7. **Respect User Boundaries**: Write into the active member's directory freely. Treat other members' folders as read-only references unless granted explicit permission.
8. **Autonomous Milestones**: Keep the Task Board up-to-date after completing meaningful units of work.
